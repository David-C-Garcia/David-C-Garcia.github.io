title: "A lysate proteome engineering strategy for enhancing cell-free metabolite production"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/CFME
excerpt: '<p style="text-align: justify;">Cell-free systems harness the metabolic potential of diverse organisms in an open and modifiable environment. Removing the cellular context provides the ability to produce biological products without the need to maintain cell viability and enables metabolic engineers to explore novel chemical transformation systems. However, only limited tools are available for engineering the contents of the extracts used for cell-free systems. While environmental variables of a cell-free system can be easily manipulated, the proteomic content of the crude extract is more difficult to engineer. We describe a framework to enable the removal of specific proteins from crude extracts for CFME resulting in a modified proteome capable of producing engineered metabolic phenotypes not possible in a living cells with minimal impact on the viability of the donor cell. </p>'
