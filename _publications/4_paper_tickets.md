title: "High-Throughput Optimization of Paper-Based Cell-Free Biosensors"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper_tickets
excerpt: '<p style="text-align: justify;">Cell-free expression systems maintain core cellular processes without intact cells and offer attractive properties as point-of-need biosensors. The ability to lyophilize, store, and use on demand makes these sensors usable in the field, and the lack of membranes means there are no analyte transport issues and new sensors can be deployed by simply adding a different DNA molecule. We present new high-throughput screening methods to optimize cell-free expression formulations when embedded into paper for use as sensors. Our method leverages acoustic liquid handling to dispense reactions onto 384-well paper ticket formats and machine vision to quantify reaction performance from a colorimetric reporter enzyme. The throughput enabled shifts the bottleneck from experimental execution to selecting the experiments We showcase the use of the cost-optimized formulation in a 3D-printed paperfluidic device where it outperforms the standard formulation at much lower cost.</p>'
