Using small molecule latch-based nanobodies as a platform, one of my first goals will be to develop a large language model (LLM) driven and experimental framework for the development of small molecule biosensors.

The use of colorimetric and luminescent reporters will not only make these tools useful for point-of-need and diagnostic applications, but also enable rapid DBTL cycles to modify the protein chain quickly and effectively to an analyte of interest. This modular approach where in sequences are individually ordered and tested allows for rapid finetuning of these transformer-based models, as even modest numbers of experiments can rapidly help converge on a desired property. The open nature of the cell-free system further enables the use of new chemistries such as click reactions with non-canonical amino acids as potential latching mechanisms, to further enable the platform to rapidly pivot to novel targets and even allow for the direct incorporation of payloads for potential therapeutic applications.

Immediate Work: Develop large language model (LLM) driven nanobody platform and experimental framework for the development of small molecule biosensors.
Long term Vision: Rapidly produced and characterized point-of-need biosensors for scalable responses.
